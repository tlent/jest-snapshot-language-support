# Jest Snapshot Language Support

Jest Snapshot Language Support provides syntax highlighting for your Jest snapshots.

Don't want the full IDE-style support from [vscode-jest][1]? This is the extension for you!

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for Jest snapshots
- Nothing else!

If you already are using [vscode-jest][1] or [snapshot-tools][2], you don't need this extension. They both have snapshot syntax highlighting built in.

Thanks to [vscode-jest][1] for the language grammar!
